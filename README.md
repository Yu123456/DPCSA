# DPCSA: Density peaks clustering based on weighted local density sequence and nearest neighbor assignment
DPCSA is a density-based clustering algorithm proposed by Donghua Yu, Maozu Guo, et al. in 2018. See our paper submitted to 
**KBS**.

### Paper information
Donghua Yu, Maozu Guo, et al. Density peaks clustering based on weighted local sequence and the nearest neighbor assignment. 2018.

### Code and Data
quick start:
- Run 'DPCSAEvaluation2.m': clustering real-world datasets
- Run 'DPCSAArtificialPlot.m': clustering artificial datasets
- Run 'DPCSAOlivettiFace.m': clustering Olivetti Face dataset

**Note:** Please change the dataset path in these code.
